## Projects

### Hotel No-Show Prediction (Python) 
Goal: To predict the No-Show of customers (using the dataset provided) to help a hotel chain to formulate policies to reduce expenses incurred due to No-Shows

Code: eda.ipynb and files under src folder

Description: The dataset contains records of hotel bookings.
The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), building an End-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, building a ml pipeline.

Technology: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, pickle, sqlite3, argparse, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy

### Aviation Incidents (Python)
Goal: To examine the incident information of airplanes and extract insights on its trends.

Code: eda-aviation-incidents.ipynb

Description: The dataset contains records of aviation incidents. The records include the date, type, registration,	operator,	fatalities,	location, country, cat and	year. 
The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing incident data.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Results: Python functions that calculated and visually presented the number of incidents/fatalities by different categories (eg. airplane type, country, year etc).
